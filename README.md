The repository contains three programs, out of which two (LeastSquares and NumberDivisions) are ready and the third (DecisiveTree, which was meant to be a basis for random forests implementation) is still not finished.

# LeastSquares
implements linear regression with the method of least squares. The programs works just fine, although it might go rouge while dealing with big datasets. Linear regression algorithm is in general not very hard to implement, but I decided to use linear-algebraic formulation of the solution. The hard part was also to write short "library" for linear algebra.

# NumberDivisions 
is a simple program finding number of ways of writing an integer k as sum of n components. I did invent the algorithm for this problem on my own in high school (liceum) for some competition.
